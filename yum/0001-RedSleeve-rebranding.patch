+#  This is the default, if you make this bigger yum won't see if the metadata
+# is newer on the remote and so you'll "gain" the bandwidth of not having to
+# download the new metadata and "pay" for it by yum not having correct
+# information.
+#  It is esp. important, to have correct metadata, for distributions like
+# Fedora which don't keep old packages around. If you don't like this checking
+# interupting your command line usage, it's much better to have something
+# manually check the metadata once an hour (yum-updatesd will do this).
